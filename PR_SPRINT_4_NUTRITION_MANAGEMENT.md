### Authorization & Security
- **Role-based access control** (trainers vs clients)
- **Trainer-only endpoints** for plan/recipe creation
- **Client-only endpoints** for meal tracking
- **JWT token authentication** for all endpoints
- **Input validation** and sanitization

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

### Comprehensive Test Coverage
- **Unit tests** for all nutrition models and services
- **Integration tests** for complete nutrition workflows
- **Authorization tests** for role-based access
- **Performance tests** for database operations
- **Security tests** for data protection

### Test Fixes Applied
- **Fixed email conflicts** by using unique UUIDs in tests
- **Corrected role authorization** using UserRole enum
- **Updated performance tests** to use proper user types
- **Fixed integration test** error handling
- **Improved test data setup** and cleanup

### Test Categories
- `test_nutrition.py` - Core nutrition functionality
- `test_auth.py` - Authentication and authorization
- `test_integration.py` - End-to-end workflows
- `test_performance.py` - Performance benchmarks
- `test_security.py` - Security validation
