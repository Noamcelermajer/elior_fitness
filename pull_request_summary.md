## Key Features & Changes

### 1. Trainer Dashboard Redesign

- The Trainer Dashboard is now the main hub for trainers, combining:
  - Overview stats (clients, exercises, workout completion).
  - A searchable, interactive client list with “View Progress” (modal) and “View Profile” actions.
- Removed the separate “Clients” page/tab for trainers; all client management is now in the dashboard.

### 2. Exercise Bank Improvements

- Exercise Bank for trainers features:
  - Aligned, modern search/filter controls.
  - Responsive, visually consistent exercise cards.

### 3. Client Profile & Progress

- Client Profile page now:
  - Shows weight progress in a modal (from dashboard or client list).
  - Features improved info cards with better alignment, icons, and spacing.
  - Allows trainers to edit client weight entries for corrections.

### 4. UI/UX Overhaul

- Cards (dashboard stats, client cards, info cards) now have:
  - Solid, dark backgrounds for depth.
  - Stronger borders and deep shadows.
  - Subtle fade-in/slide-up animation and 3D “lift” on hover.
- Improved typography, spacing, and alignment throughout.
- Consistent, modern look across all trainer/admin pages.

### 5. System Monitoring

- System page now displays real system and Docker stats, with graceful fallback if Docker is unavailable.
- Backend service for system stats added, with documentation.

### 6. Role-Based Navigation & Access

- Navigation and dashboard content are now strictly role-based:
  - Trainers see only relevant tools (Dashboard, Exercise Bank).
  - Admins and clients have their own tailored navigation and dashboards.

### 7. TypeScript & Code Quality

- All new/updated code passes strict TypeScript checks.
- Improved prop typing and data normalization for cross-component compatibility.
