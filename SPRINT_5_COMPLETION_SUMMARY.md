# 🎉 Sprint 5: File Management & Storage - COMPLETED

## ✅ Implementation Status: **FULLY COMPLETED**

All Sprint 5 objectives have been successfully implemented and tested:

### 🎯 Completed Features

#### 1. ✅ Secure File Uploads with Validation
- **MIME type validation** using `python-magic` library
- **File size limits** (10MB images, 25MB documents, 5MB profiles)
- **Content integrity checks** using PIL for images
- **Security validation** preventing malicious uploads
- **Multiple file format support** (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, PDF, DOC, DOCX)

#### 2. ✅ Image Processing (Resizing, Thumbnails)
- **Automatic thumbnail generation** (150x150px)
- **Multiple size variants** (medium: 800x800px, large: 1920x1920px)
- **Format optimization** with JPEG compression
- **Quality settings** for storage optimization
- **Error handling** for processing failures

#### 3. ✅ Storage Optimization (Folder Structure, Cleanup)
- **Organized directory structure**:
  ```
  uploads/
  ├── meal_photos/      # Client meal documentation
  ├── profile_photos/   # User profile pictures  
  ├── progress_photos/  # Client progress images
  ├── documents/        # Document uploads
  ├── thumbnails/       # Processed image variants
  └── temp/            # Temporary storage
  ```
- **UUID-based filenames** preventing conflicts
- **Automatic cleanup** of orphaned files
- **Storage statistics** monitoring

#### 4. ✅ Access Control on Media Endpoints
- **Role-based access control** (trainer vs client permissions)
- **File ownership validation** (users access only their files)
- **Trainer-client relationship** access (trainers can view client files)
- **Secure file serving** through authenticated endpoints
- **Protected deletion** with authorization checks

#### 5. ✅ Real-time Updates (WebSocket Implementation)
- **Comprehensive WebSocket service** for notifications
- **Real-time file upload notifications**
- **Meal completion alerts** for trainers
- **Progress update notifications**
- **Connection management** with user subscriptions
- **Message broadcasting** between users

## 🚀 New API Endpoints

### File Management (`/api/files/`)
- `GET /media/{file_type}/{filename}` - Serve files with access control
- `DELETE /media/{file_type}/{filename}` - Delete files with authorization  
- `GET /media/stats` - Storage statistics (trainers/admins only)

### WebSocket Communication (`/api/ws/`)
- `WebSocket /ws/{user_id}` - Real-time notification connection
- `GET /ws/stats` - Connection statistics
- `POST /ws/test-notification/{user_id}` - Test notifications

### Enhanced Nutrition (`/api/nutrition/`)
- `POST /photos/upload` - Enhanced photo upload with file processing
- `GET /photos/list` - List user's nutrition photos
- `POST /meal-completions/{id}/photo` - Meal photo upload with notifications

## 🏗️ Architecture Enhancements

### Core Services Added
- **`FileService`** - Comprehensive file management with validation and processing
- **`WebSocketService`** - Real-time notifications and connection management

### Routers Added
- **`files.py`** - File management endpoints with access control
- **`websocket.py`** - WebSocket connection and notification handling

### Enhanced Integrations
- **Nutrition router** enhanced with FileService integration
- **WebSocket notifications** on file uploads and meal completions
- **Authentication** extended for WebSocket connections

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### File Upload Security
- **Magic number validation** (not just extension checking)
- **Content validation** ensuring file integrity
- **Size limits** preventing DoS attacks
- **Path traversal protection** with secure naming

### Access Control
- **JWT authentication** required for all file operations
- **Role-based permissions** enforced consistently
- **Entity ownership** validation for fine-grained access
- **Cross-user access** only through trainer-client relationships

### WebSocket Security
- **Token-based authentication** for connections
- **User ID validation** preventing impersonation
- **Graceful error handling** with proper cleanup

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Test Coverage
- **Unit tests** for FileService validation and processing
- **Integration tests** for WebSocket notifications
- **Security tests** for access control validation
- **API endpoint tests** for all new functionality

### Validation Results
- ✅ **libmagic** properly installed and working
- ✅ **FileService** initializes and processes files correctly
- ✅ **WebSocketService** manages connections and notifications
- ✅ **Application** starts without import errors
- ✅ **API endpoints** registered and accessible
- ✅ **Upload directories** created with proper structure

## 📱 Real-time Update Capabilities

### WebSocket Notification Types
- **`FILE_UPLOADED`** - File upload confirmations
- **`FILE_DELETED`** - File deletion notifications  
- **`MEAL_COMPLETED`** - Meal completion alerts
- **`PROGRESS_UPDATED`** - Progress record updates
- **`MESSAGE`** - Direct user messaging
- **`SYSTEM`** - System notifications

### Frontend Integration Ready
```javascript
// Example WebSocket connection
const ws = new WebSocket(`ws://localhost:8000/api/ws/ws/${userId}?token=${token}`);
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const notification = JSON.parse(event.data);
    handleRealTimeNotification(notification);
};
```
