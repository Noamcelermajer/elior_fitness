# Routing Fix Summary - Meal Plan Categories

**Date**: 2025-01-11
**Issue**: Fixed meal plan page showing fixed categories (Lunch, Dinner, Snack, Breakfast)
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Problem Identified

The user reported seeing fixed meal categories (Lunch, Dinner, Snack, Breakfast) in the meal plan interface, which contradicted our new flexible meal system.

### Root Cause
The application was routing to the **old** `CreateMealPlanPage.tsx` instead of our **updated** `CreateMealPlanV2.tsx`:

```
❌ OLD: /create-meal-plan → CreateMealPlanPage.tsx (fixed categories)
✅ NEW: /create-meal-plan → CreateMealPlanV2.tsx (flexible meals)
```

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed App.tsx Routing** ✅
```typescript
// Before (OLD - fixed categories)
import CreateMealPlan from './pages/CreateMealPlan';
<Route path="/create-meal-plan" element={<CreateMealPlan />} />

// After (NEW - flexible meals)
import CreateMealPlanV2 from './pages/CreateMealPlanV2';
<Route path="/create-meal-plan" element={<CreateMealPlanV2 />} />
```

### 2. **Cleaned Up Duplicate Routes** ✅
- Removed duplicate import of `CreateMealPlanV2`
- Removed redundant `/create-meal-plan-v2` route
- Now single route `/create-meal-plan` uses the new system

---

## Result

### Before Fix ❌
```
Meal Plan Page:
├── Breakfast (fixed)
├── Lunch (fixed) 
├── Dinner (fixed)
├── Snack (fixed)
└── Pre-Workout (fixed)
```

### After Fix ✅
```
Meal Plan Page:
├── No meals added yet
├── [Add Meal] button
├── Meal 1 (when added)
├── Meal 2 (when added)
├── Meal 3 (when added)
└── ... (unlimited meals)
```

---

## New User Experience

### Step 1: Access Create Meal Plan
- Navigate to "Create Meal Plan" from trainer dashboard
- **Result**: Now shows empty form with "Add Meal" button

### Step 2: Add Meals Manually
- Click "Add Meal" to create Meal 1
- Click "Add Meal" again for Meal 2
- Continue adding as many meals as needed

### Step 3: Each Meal Has 3 Categories
```
Meal 1:
├── 🌾 CARBS: (add food items)
├── 💪 PROTEIN: (add food items)  
└── 🥑 FAT: (add food items)

Meal 2:
├── 🌾 CARBS: (add food items)
├── 💪 PROTEIN: (add food items)
└── 🥑 FAT: (add food items)
```
