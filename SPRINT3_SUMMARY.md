## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### New Database Models
- **`SessionCompletion`**: Tracks workout session completions with duration and difficulty
- **`ProgressRecord`**: Stores body metrics and progress over time  
- **Enhanced `ExerciseCompletion`**: Already existed, enhanced with better relationships

### New API Endpoints
```
POST   /api/progress/sessions/complete          # Complete a session
GET    /api/progress/sessions/{id}/completion   # Get session completion
GET    /api/progress/sessions/{id}/status       # Get session status
GET    /api/progress/workout-plans/{id}/status  # Get workout plan status
POST   /api/progress/records                    # Create progress record
GET    /api/progress/summary                    # Get progress summary
POST   /api/progress/reports                    # Generate progress report
POST   /api/progress/reports/export             # Export progress report
```

### Database Migration
- Created Alembic migration for new progress tracking tables
- Properly configured foreign key relationships
- Added appropriate indexes for performance

### Comprehensive Testing
- **15 test cases** covering all Sprint 3 functionality
- **100% pass rate** after fixes
