# Sprint 5: File Management & Storage - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Sprint 5 Objectives Completed

Sprint 5 has been successfully implemented with all the requested features:

### ✅ 1. Secure File Uploads with Validation
- **Comprehensive file validation** using `python-magic` for MIME type detection
- **File size limits** configurable per file type (images: 10MB, documents: 25MB, profile photos: 5MB)
- **Content validation** including image integrity checks using PIL
- **Security validation** to prevent malicious file uploads

### ✅ 2. Image Processing (Resizing, Thumbnails)
- **Automatic thumbnail generation** (150x150px) for all uploaded images
- **Multiple size variants** (medium: 800x800px, large: 1920x1920px)
- **Format optimization** with JPEG compression and quality settings
- **Efficient processing** using PIL with proper error handling

### ✅ 3. Storage Optimization (Folder Structure, Cleanup)
- **Organized folder structure**: `uploads/{category}/{files}` and `uploads/thumbnails/`
- **Unique filename generation** using UUIDs to prevent conflicts
- **Automatic cleanup** of orphaned files with configurable age limits
- **Storage statistics** endpoint for monitoring disk usage

### ✅ 4. Access Control on Media Endpoints
- **Role-based access control** with trainer/client permissions
- **Entity-based permissions** (users can only access their own files or assigned clients' files)
- **Secure file serving** through authenticated endpoints
- **Protected deletion** with proper authorization checks

### ✅ 5. Real-time Updates (WebSocket Implementation)
- **Comprehensive WebSocket service** for real-time notifications
- **File upload notifications** sent to relevant users
- **Trainer-client relationship** notifications for meal completions and progress updates
- **Connection management** with user subscription handling

### Git Configuration
- `.gitignore` - Improved cache file exclusion patterns

## 🚀 API Endpoints Added

### File Management (`/api/files/`)
- `GET /media/{file_type}/{filename}` - Serve media files with access control
- `DELETE /media/{file_type}/{filename}` - Delete media files with authorization
- `GET /media/stats` - Get storage statistics (admin/trainer only)

### WebSocket (`/api/ws/`)
- `WebSocket /ws/{user_id}` - Real-time notification connection
- `GET /ws/stats` - WebSocket connection statistics
- `POST /ws/test-notification/{user_id}` - Test notification endpoint

### Enhanced Nutrition (`/api/nutrition/`)
- `POST /photos/upload` - Enhanced photo upload with file service integration
- `GET /photos/list` - List nutrition-related photos for users

## 🔒 Security Features

### File Upload Security
- **MIME type validation** using magic number detection
- **File size limits** to prevent DoS attacks
- **Content validation** to ensure file integrity
- **Path traversal protection** with secure filename generation

### Access Control
- **Authentication required** for all file operations
- **Role-based permissions** (trainer vs client access)
- **Entity ownership** validation (users can only access their own files)
- **Trainer-client relationship** validation for cross-user access

### WebSocket Security
- **JWT token authentication** for WebSocket connections
- **User ID validation** to prevent impersonation
- **Graceful error handling** with proper connection cleanup

## 📊 File Management Features

### Supported File Types
- **Images**: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF
- **Documents**: PDF, DOC, DOCX
- **Categories**: Meal photos, profile photos, progress photos, documents

### Image Processing
- **Automatic resizing** to multiple sizes
- **Thumbnail generation** for quick previews
- **Format conversion** to optimize storage
- **Quality optimization** to balance size and quality

### Storage Organization
```
uploads/
├── meal_photos/           # Client meal documentation
├── profile_photos/        # User profile pictures
├── progress_photos/       # Client progress images
├── documents/            # Various document uploads
├── thumbnails/           # Processed image variants
└── temp/                 # Temporary file storage
```

## 🔔 Real-time Notification Types

### File Operations
- `FILE_UPLOADED` - When files are successfully uploaded
- `FILE_DELETED` - When files are removed

### Nutrition Events
- `MEAL_COMPLETED` - When clients complete meal entries
- `PROGRESS_UPDATED` - When progress records are updated

### Communication
- `MESSAGE` - Direct messaging between users
- `SYSTEM` - System notifications and alerts

## 🧪 Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests
- **FileService** validation and processing
- **WebSocketService** connection and notification management
- **File upload** endpoints with authentication
- **Access control** validation

### Integration Tests

- **Real-time notification** delivery
- **Cross-service** integration between nutrition and file management

### Security Tests
- **File access control** across different user roles
- **Upload validation** with various file types
- **WebSocket authentication** and authorization

## 🔮 Real-time Update Implementation

While you mentioned "if frontend doesn't exist i have no idea how to do this", the WebSocket implementation is fully functional and ready for frontend integration:

### WebSocket Connection
```javascript
// Frontend example for connecting to WebSocket
const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
const userId = getCurrentUserId();
const ws = new WebSocket(`ws://localhost:8000/api/ws/ws/${userId}?token=${token}`);

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const notification = JSON.parse(event.data);
    handleNotification(notification);
};
```

### Notification Handling
The WebSocket service sends structured notifications that a frontend can easily consume:
- File upload confirmations
- Meal completion alerts for trainers
- Progress updates
- System notifications

## 💡 Usage Examples

### File Upload with Nutrition Integration
```python
# Client uploads meal photo
POST /api/nutrition/photos/upload?meal_completion_id=123
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

# Response includes file processing results and WebSocket notification is sent
```

### Real-time Notification Flow
1. Client uploads meal photo
2. File is validated, processed, and stored
3. WebSocket notification sent to client (confirmation)
4. WebSocket notification sent to trainer (new meal photo from client)
5. Both users can access the file through secure endpoints

## 🎉 Sprint 5 Success
