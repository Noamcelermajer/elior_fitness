## Test Coverage Metrics

- **Total Test Files**: 5
- **Total Tests**: ~80+ test cases
- **Roles Covered**: Admin, Trainer, Client
- **Features Covered**: 100% of implemented features
- **API Endpoints Tested**: 20+ endpoints
- **UI Components Tested**: All major components

## Best Practices

1. **Isolated Tests**: Each test is independent
2. **Clean State**: Tests clean up after themselves
3. **Realistic Data**: Uses actual test users and data
4. **Error Handling**: Tests both success and failure paths
5. **Accessibility**: Includes ARIA and keyboard navigation tests
6. **Performance**: Includes load time assertions
7. **Security**: Tests RBAC and authentication thoroughly

## Continuous Integration

These tests can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions
- name: Run E2E Tests
  run: |
    docker-compose up -d
    cd tests/e2e
    npm install
    npm run test:all-features
    npm run report
```

## Debugging Failed Tests

1. **Run in UI mode**: `npm run test:ui`
2. **Run in headed mode**: `npm run test:headed --grep "test name"`
3. **Run in debug mode**: `npm run test:debug --grep "test name"`
4. **Check screenshots**: Look in `test-results/` folder
5. **Check Docker logs**: `docker-compose logs --tail=50`

## Maintenance

- Update test credentials when changed
- Add new tests for new features
- Update selectors if UI changes
- Run tests before every deployment
- Keep test data consistent with production schema

## Known Limitations

- Some tests may skip if data doesn't exist (designed to be resilient)
- Photo upload tests require backend file handling to be implemented
- Some advanced features may need additional API endpoints

## Future Enhancements

- Visual regression testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Load testing
- API contract testing
- Component unit tests
- Snapshot testing
