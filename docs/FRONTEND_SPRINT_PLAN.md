    if (response.status === 401) {
      await tokenManager.refreshToken();
      return apiClient.request(endpoint, options);
    }
    
    return response;
  }
};
```

### **Error Handling**:
```typescript
// Centralized error handling
const handleApiError = (error: any, endpoint: string) => {
  if (error.status === 401) {
    // Redirect to login
    router.push('/login');
  } else if (error.status === 403) {
    // Show permission denied message
    showNotification('You don\'t have permission for this action', 'error');
  } else if (error.status >= 500) {
    // Show server error with retry option
    showNotification('Server error. Please try again.', 'error');
  } else {
    // Show generic error
    showNotification('Something went wrong. Please try again.', 'error');
  }
};
```

### **Offline Support**:
```typescript
// Offline data management
const offlineManager = {
  queue: [] as any[],
  
  addToQueue: (action: any) => {
    offlineManager.queue.push(action);
    localStorage.setItem('offline_queue', JSON.stringify(offlineManager.queue));
  },
  
  syncWhenOnline: async () => {
    if (navigator.onLine && offlineManager.queue.length > 0) {
      const queue = [...offlineManager.queue];
      offlineManager.queue = [];
      
      for (const action of queue) {
        try {
          await apiClient.request(action.endpoint, action.options);
        } catch (error) {
          // Re-queue failed actions
          offlineManager.addToQueue(action);
        }
      }
    }
  }
};
```
