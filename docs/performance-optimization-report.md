- High bandwidth usage

### 3. File Handling Performance

#### Current Issues:
- **Synchronous file operations** blocking event loop
- **No image compression** or optimization
- **Missing file caching** strategies
- **Large image processing** without async handling

#### Impact:
- Slow file upload/download times
- High server resource usage
- Poor user experience for image-heavy features

### 4. Frontend Performance Issues

#### Current Issues:
- **No code splitting** or lazy loading
- **Large bundle size** with all dependencies loaded upfront
- **No image optimization** for web delivery
- **Missing performance monitoring**
- **No caching strategies** for API calls

#### Impact:
- Slow initial page load times
- Large JavaScript bundles
- Poor mobile performance

### 5. Memory and Resource Usage

#### Current Issues:
- **WebSocket connections** not properly managed
- **Large objects** held in memory unnecessarily
- **No resource cleanup** for long-running processes
- **Missing memory optimization** for image processing
