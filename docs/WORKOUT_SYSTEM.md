# Elior Fitness Workout Management System

## Overview

The Elior Fitness Workout Management System provides a comprehensive solution for personal trainers to manage their exercise bank, create custom workout plans, and track client progress. The system is designed to be flexible and practical for real-world training scenarios.

## Key Features

### üèãÔ∏è Exercise Bank Management
- **Trainer-owned exercise library**: Each trainer maintains their own categorized exercise bank
- **Muscle group categorization**: Exercises are organized by muscle groups (chest, back, shoulders, biceps, triceps, legs, core, cardio, full_body, other)
- **Detailed exercise information**: Name, description, video URL, equipment needed, and step-by-step instructions
- **Search and filtering**: Find exercises by muscle group, trainer, or search terms

### üìÖ Workout Plan Creation
- **Custom workout plans**: Trainers create personalized plans for each client
- **Flexible structure**: No predefined templates - trainers build plans based on client needs
- **Session organization**: Plans can have multiple workout sessions (e.g., "Day 1: Upper Body", "Cardio Day")
- **Scheduling support**: Optional day-of-week assignment for recurring schedules

### üéØ Exercise Assignment
- **Unlimited exercises**: No artificial limits on how many exercises per workout
- **Flexible parameters**: Sets, reps (as strings to support "8-12", "30 seconds", "to failure"), rest time, and notes
- **Order management**: Exercises are ordered within each session
- **Bulk operations**: Add multiple exercises to a session at once

### üìä Progress Tracking
- **Exercise completion logging**: Clients log their actual performance
- **Flexible data capture**: Actual sets, reps, weight used, difficulty rating, and notes
- **Form photo uploads**: Optional photo uploads for form assessment
- **Bulk completion**: Log multiple exercise completions at once

### üìà Analytics and Reporting
- **Workout summaries**: Completion rates, total sessions, and progress overview
- **Exercise progress**: Individual exercise performance tracking over time
- **Performance trends**: Average sets, reps, weights, and difficulty ratings
- **Progress visualization**: Historical data for client and trainer review
