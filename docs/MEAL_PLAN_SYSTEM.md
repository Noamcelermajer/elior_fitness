4. Trainer receives notification via WebSocket
5. Trainer can approve/reject the meal

### Analytics Generation
1. System calculates completion rates from `meal_uploads`
2. System calculates nutritional totals from `meal_components`
3. Summary data is returned for progress tracking

## üöÄ Integration Points

### WebSocket Notifications
